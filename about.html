<q>They were exactly what we were looking for when we started to plan our wedding. They were super patient with all our questions during the planning process and during the days just prior to our wedding. We honestly couldnâ€™t have asked for a better team of professionals to make our day the most amazing day ever. Khushian were and are so sweet, down to earth and personable!</q>
